          In order to solve the problem set question I was assigned (Logarithms), I reasoned out with our group leader the possible constraints to narrow our strategy. Eventually, we were satisfied with our brainstorming to realize that y needed to be a fraction in order for a quotient equation to result in a larger number than the product of the variables. There were other breakthroughs too that arose from logical conclusions.

          Unemployment, economic inequality, and other socio-political demographic markers of a country all use graphs. In GenMath, we were taught not only to interpret real life graphs, but also sketch models ourselves. I became less averse to even other graphs like scatterplots or charts, since we've graphed problems much harder like exponential decay and inverse functions.

        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          Whether or not I intend to carry over these lessons to the real world doesn't matter, since the course has already shaped my mentality when looking at a graph. What does this y intercept mean? What does it mean when a variable is at 0? What's the range and domain? They all have demographic counterparts and with issues like unemployment, statistics are vital.

          I loved our problem set group this quarter because they're always so willing to help each other and work together. Even if we were assigned a specific problem to perfect, I recall some days before submission we would huddle around during lunch in order to double check and triple check every problem. And even though I felt like we didn't need to check anymore, we would still find more inaccuracies or details we can improve on. That was the beauty of having more eyes and more minds.

          That was the dreaded word I would hear almost every morning. Someone comes to me with a math problem from the lesson. My classmates think I'm smart, and I'm actually not, and definitely not gifted in math. But I have the love for math, and sometimes that's more than enough to do well. When they come to me, I try to help, even if I haven't had time to study and practice yet.

          Sometimes I feel like a fraud, since maybe as a Chinese guy with glasses, I should be great at it. Nevertheless, I channeled my friends' reliance on my help in order to push me to study harder, so I can answer them when they ask. Because they think I get good grades, I try my best to. I turned it into something positive, while also helping others.

          It's not necessarily a time management problem, but rather since I'm good at handling my time, I spent it in the strangest ways possible to make my schedule fit. So yes, I did most of my GenMath in the car, with both laptop and notebook somehow on my lap. My pencil will shake and I will bump up and down, but in the end, I studied math. I solved equations. My friends always think I've gone mad when I say I do this. For me, math is comforting and I shouldn't waste travel time. This was my "innovative" solution to a grave problem of lack of time.

          There were several instances where I forgot a key concept or fact during the MA or LT. This was a crisis, since a single misunderstanding could ruin 10 points at once. So, what I did was I simply sped up my solving to allow time to verify. To check if I had inverted a function correctly, I would invert it back to the original problem. If it worked, then I was right. Another way I verified was by injecting x values and matching the equation with the graph. It took more time, but it was worth it in the end.

          I've learned 2 life lessons this quarter. First, it is just as helpful to me when I help others, since it forces me to truly grasp the lesson and explain it verbally. I also need to be used to asking questions as well, whether to the teacher or classmates smarter than me. Second, I learned that there are more than one beautiful ways to prove and find an answer. It's kind of fun being able to cohere all the given information to find the characteristics of a graph. And it's also cool to either input values or reverse the process in order to manipulate a function.

          Although our mathematics was general, our classes were always special.
      
          Now that we have learned about log ln, it's time to log out. Goodbye, Ma'am. Farewell, GenMath.

          I found GenMath to be eye-opening because it directly translates to some concept I need to learn in Computer Science. I'm aiming to be a Financial Cybersecurity Engineer, and it's often said that logarithms are mostly used in the real world by technology programmers. We use log base 2 for binary and bytes. There's also functions, which we use every day to code our programs and scripts. Lastly, graphing is crucial to the financial aspect of my interests, especially compound interest. Overall I'm thankful for this course and think it's true value has yet to be seen far into the future.
