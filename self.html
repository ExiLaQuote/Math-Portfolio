      <br><br><span>ELEMENTARY</span>

      <br><br>Ever since Grade 2, I knew I wasn’t cut out for math. There was a “Math Club”, some special class the smart ones went to instead of going to the regular Home Economics. I wasn’t in the upper third who could go. Grade 3, and I wasn’t invited either. This went on until Grade 6, where it ended. . . because it was now called “Math Training”. In elementary I was still writing Sci-Fi Fantasy novels. I wanted to become a writer. I mostly definitely had the skills and potential. I was just average in the sciences. I didn’t really mind it.

      <br><br><span>HIGH SCHOOL&nbsp; [7-9]</span>

      <br><br>In Grade 7, the entire half of the class were brought to Math Training while the rest, including me, studied in TLE. I recall blaming this on the fact that I didn’t go to Math Club before. But then again, I didn’t do well on the diagnostic test. That’s why. This continued on until Grade 9. I wasn’t interested in a math-related career, but I still wanted to reach for something higher. To be with my close friends, who were up there in the smarter half. At some point I said I had enough. If I can’t get the more advanced lessons they’re being taught, then I’ll go learn it myself elsewhere. I asked them for their curriculum, then went ahead and self-studied. It was ironic since I loved math, while those who win math competitions abroad regularly say they hate it. But because I had this odd desire to learn math, I did so, throughout summers and even on Christmas vacations. I’d enter the hotel room and immediately open Khan Academy on my iPad. I trudged through with brute determination. 

      <br><br><span>HIGH SCHOOL&nbsp; [10-11]</span>
      
      <br><br>By Grade 10, I discovered programming (computer science) and realized that STEM was for me. I never lost my artistic skills, but I was now laser-focused on the sciences, and that meant being great at math. I liked to do things by hand, manually and computationally, and slowly I saw how math was stunningly beautiful. It was not just formulas, but true logical thought. And I built up my logic through two years of analytic philosophy. This is why I love trigonometric identities and mathematical induction. Today, I’m not bad at math anymore. I wanted to prove this as I start a new year in a new school, and so far it’s going wonderfully! I never dreamed in my life that I would be the group leader for a math problem set. My classmates think I’m good at math. And I just want to tell them that I wasn’t even in the top 50% of my class. I want to tell them that because of my average grades, I was first put in GA. I had to appeal for STEM. So this was all hard-earned. Others will simply chalk it up to me being Chinese or that I come from a math-focused school. But no, I think anyone can be excellent at math if they so choose. If they so love.
