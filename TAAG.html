          I loved proving and manipulating trigonometric identities. It was immensely satisfying and I could do (and have done) such problems for just hours without any sense of boredom or dread. I’m strongly drawn to analytic or a-priori modes of problem solving, where all I need to solve is in the problem itself and my task is to draw out the logical implications deductively.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          Naturally, since Problem Set #2 asked us to prove an identity statement, I tried my hand at that with eagerness. However, it was difficult. Then, it became distressing. After many days of many hours, I had only mathematical roadblocks scribbled on countless papers. I was the group leader. Our tactic was that we would all solve one at a time individually but consult together if necessary. So far, our only progress was that half our groupmates declared their surrender to this problem. And they were those who scored highest in the quizzes. If no groupmate could do it, as the group leader it was unfortunately my responsibility to solve it.

          So, I picked up my double-edged pencil and tried again. Again and again. One of our members was able to realize a fundamental mistake in our concept of sin3a. We all treated it as sin2a+sina, not realizing it should have been sin(2a+a), and therefore must use the formula for the sum of trigonometric identities. After starting anew in the right direction, alas, we were stuck again. Arguably in an even worse place. Nevertheless, it had to be done. It was about two weeks later that I wrote out a proof that spanned four small papers. It was a magical moment.

        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          I mention this proud story of mine, not because I was able to solve it only due to my JHS having more advanced math. This is me being better than my group members either. This is me being better in math than my past self. I have improved. I can solve my problems to which there is no searchable answer or a simple proof. My hard-work, dedication, and love for mathematics paid off.

          I would also make sure that they feel praised and acknowledged. I do this consciously, maturely, and intentionally. No one’s contributions were overlooked or forgotten. In fact, after we solved and confirmed the answers to problems #1 and #2, I was so happy that I sent: “For #1 - thank you Enda for being the first to answer and setting up the equation for everyone, and to Aine, Sebie, and Ava for double checking, which led us to the real right answer. For #2: thank you JM for providing the all-glorious key insight. Only because of that could I then finally prove it, and of course we also appreciate anyone who tried! I'd say we all did our part. Just 2 questions but it feels like a victory hahaha love this group!”

          I genuinely meant it. I love my group, and they respect me as the leader. They were always willing to listen and correct the errors I point out, but they were also brave to question my solution and propose other ways to do things. This goes for the final solution formatting, the way we divided the questions, and if I made a careless mistake.

          Just like everyone else, we had to memorize all the equations for the conic sections. There were quite a lot, and although the foci and vertices could be recalled by thinking intuitively and visualizing it, it would be too slow for the quizzes and long test especially. So, I had to instinctively know it well. My solution was to formulate a little cheat sheet that I wrote in brevity but understand deeply. This tactic served to be amazing, since during the long test, I just spent five minutes writing my entire synthesized notes on scratch paper. Then I was set. The rest of the test I only had to look at the paper I wrote.

          My harsher situation this math quarter was my initial shortcomings in the first long test (semi-finals). Because Module 4 had come out and was new, I spent more time on that (and Trig Functions). I thought that the first few lessons were easy enough. I told myself I shouldn’t waste my time on easy concepts like the unit circle when I had trigonometric zeroes to solve for. Well, on the day of the test, I flunked. It was embarrassing. As the highest scorers were being announced, my friends were cheering my name. But I kept shaking my head because I knew I didn’t even get S. I wasn’t sure what happened that morning. That’s what I pretend to think. But I knew that I didn’t review the trigonometric points and translations by pi. In the final analysis, I can’t do anything about my C, but I can attain an S in the final component if I get an S on the finals.

          Two modules later and it’s the day before the second long test. I had started studying days before. This time, I made sure I didn’t neglect the earliest, easiest lesson about circles. I reviewed the section about tangents and memorized my little cheat sheet for the other conic sections. Then on the morning of the test day, I even solved induction and divisibility problems the entire car ride to Ateneo. Upon arriving, I didn’t go to the classroom, but instead went to the library to finish. Inside the class, I had to force myself to sacrifice not talking with my friends or with Group A. I studied until the last moment. And I think I did well! For me it was challengingly easy!

          I have learned two lessons that I intend on holding close to my heart moving forward in academics and in life. First, on the individual level, don’t underestimate the simplest lesson. It is precisely because they are the easiest that they will be made complicated for major tests. Especially in math, a concept or equation can always be made harder, whether as integrated with other lessons or as a word problem.

        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          Second, in a group, ensure that everyone agrees or disagrees on each step, one at a time. This goes for solving literal algebraic steps, but also for any group project. The plan must be agreed upon, then the execution, and everything in between. Since what comes after depends on what came before, it should be a solid foundation. Likewise, failing to catch an elementary mistake in a proof can lead the entire group down the wrong rabbit hole. So when solving our Problem Set questions, if we hit a dead end, we would always start from the beginning or a point of conflict.

          Where do I intend on using this for my future? I am aiming for a career in Computer Science. I have already taken several online courses such as Princeton, and when analyzing algorithms, they must prove that it works. They used induction. At that point in the course, I was lost. This proving thing didn’t make sense. But now it does, and I’m excited to apply this understanding to my dreams. It also makes sense that I like proving trigonometric identities as well. Based on what I know, these two topics converge around discrete mathematics, which happens to be the most important field of mathematics for computer science. Excellent.
