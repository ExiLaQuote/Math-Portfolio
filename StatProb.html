          As the Problem Set group leader I had a responsibility and obligation to the grades of my groupmates. I could not mess this up. I acknowledged early on that Statistics would require utmost care in handling data. There were 915 rows. At first this was intimidating, but with much work and confusion, I was able to devise a system to sort through the dataset, one which was more efficient than what the internet would have us do. With this, I recorded myself explaining and sent the videos to the others. We were set to begin.

          Meanwhile, however, I felt unsure of my own abilities. I felt like a hypocrite. Even since Trigonometry everyone thought I was great at Math. I knew I wasn't, but the grades were good. Yet now I just got a C for MA1, the very first test. I was even more embarrassed since I loved discrete mathematics involving set theory, logic, and probability. I couldn't believe it. And so I continued to do my best. I studied hard and got an S in the first long test. I say I can solve problems not because I did well on the test, but because I solved the problem within me. Or did I?

          One afternoon I contemplated personality tests. Was the MBTI reliable? So having gone through Module 2 about mean and variance, as well as remembering my basic statistics, I set out to test my conjecture: that personality tests must be determined across several days, since there is inherent instability when describing one's self in a single disposition of emotions and a mere single moment. Taking the test after a family fight will yield a different personality than if I take it after calling with my crush.

          Essentially I grouped together all the 5 values from 5 days for each personality aspect. I chose the left traits, meaning if it's below 50% then I possess more of the opposite trait. Note that every time before taking the MBTI, I wrote down my mood in that very moment. So, after all these values I could average out each column to attain my "true" or at least more reliable personality. Behold, it ended up being fairly consistent with the personalities that constituted that final result. So sure, it's clear that the standard deviation must not be too wide then. However, it was far more interesting to analyze how the values varied under which trait. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          I found out that my Extroversion and Assertiveness were most subject to change, which we would expect since they are influenced by external forces. Nevertheless, I was ENFP-A, with T for thinking versus F feeling being 50%-50%. I was pleased with the result, even if contradicted my initial proposition. Personality was in fact not as volatile as one might think it is. I recommend anyone else to try this for themselves, to find out their weighted personality as well as which traits are most susceptible to changing. But I was also delighted that I was able to use statistics and a statistician's mindset in the real world, in an experiment not often done at all.

          While it might make sense to distribute and divide the work among our team into the different lesson sections, I operated under a strict principle. This principle was "independent cross-referencing." I believe in checking each other's work by doing your own work. If they were to help each other, they would either make the same mistake, or by too shy to try a different method entirely. I needed independent sources to corroborate into our final answer. In this way, the majority wins, yet we would make sure we knew why the minority's answers were flawed.

          As the group leader I tasked myself with going over all their answers one-by-one, person-by-person and input their answers into a spreadsheet. Here we could easily compare our answers and see if most of us thought of the same thing. I didn't release this sheet so that they wouldn't see others' answers and rely on those or be shamed because their answers were far different.

          I would also make sure that they feel praised and acknowledged. I do this consciously, maturely, and intentionally. No one’s contributions were overlooked or forgotten. I'd say we all did our part.

        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          I genuinely meant it. I love my group, and they respect me as the leader. They were always willing to listen and correct the errors I point out, but they were also brave to question my solution and propose other ways to do things. This goes for the final solution formatting, the way we divided the questions, and if I made a careless mistake.

          I will be completely honest. I have this problem when taking quizzes. They are due at 9am the next day, and I'm a night owl (detrimental). For context, the earlier weeks of StatProb were online for 2 weeks and every other day henceforth. I don't do well online, learning or taking the test. Since I would fail to understand or listen to one lecture, I wouldn't be able to process the next. I procrastinated and I crammed. When I had to take my Quiz, I still had yet to answer the worksheets. So, I started at 1am to review the lesson and take notes. Then I'd do the exercises and finally finish the test at around 4am. This was horrible. And worst part was, I didn't learn my lesson and did this for all 3 times. I'm so sorry.

          However, I would always feel bad and do my best for the respective Long Tests. By this time I would realize the lesson was in fact easy and common sense. I would realize that I could have done so much better in the MAs if only I were wise. I got all S in all 3 LTs, and I regret not doing as well of a job in the quizzes. Sadly, due to the categorical and fatalistic nature of ASHS's grading system, I would get HP in StatProb no matter what. I'm disappointed, but I guess I accept whatever is the end result.

          I have learned two lessons that I intend on holding close to my heart moving forward in academics and in life. First, on the individual level, don’t underestimate the simplest lesson. It is precisely because they are the easiest that they will be made complicated for major tests. Especially in math, a concept or equation can always be made harder, whether as integrated with other lessons or as a word problem. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          Second, in a group, ensure that everyone agrees or disagrees on each step, one at a time. This goes for solving literal algebraic steps, but also for any group project. The plan must be agreed upon, then the execution, and everything in between. Since what comes after depends on what came before, it should be a solid foundation. Likewise, failing to catch an elementary mistake in counting and conditionally filtering the data can lead the entire group down the wrong rabbit hole. So when solving our Problem Set questions, we would always ensure that all steps are manual and independent. There must not only be many groupmates answering the problem, but just as many methods of solving them. This way, every procedure is iron-strong.

          Where do I intend on using this for my future? I am aiming for a career in Computer Science and Data Analysis. I should be able to not only compute for statistics but program in those very computations with the end goal of automation and precision. THe first module also converged around discrete mathematics, which happens to be the most important field of mathematics for computer science. Excellent.
